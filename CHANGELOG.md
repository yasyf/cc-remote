## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`orca.keys.typesafe` hands every Orca worker a TypeSafe key.** When the
  config names a command for `typesafe`, cc-remote runs it beside the agent
  and judge key commands, sends its output down the same one-use key pipe,
  and the worker's terminal exports it as `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` before it starts
  Claude or Codex. That is the variable capt-hook's `evt.decide` reads on an
  API actor. The key joins the credential set that Codex's shell policy
  excludes and that the pool fill and grant probes strip. A failing command
  stops the launch, the same as a failing judge key, and leaving it
  unconfigured changes nothing.
